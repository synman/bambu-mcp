# bambu-mcp Project Instructions

## ⚠️ DEPENDENCY UPDATES — HARD STOP, CONSULT USER FIRST

**Never update, add, remove, or reinstall any bambu-mcp dependency without explicit user approval in the current conversation turn.**

This applies to:
- `pyproject.toml` dependencies (adding, removing, or version-pinning)
- Direct `pip install` calls into the MCP venv (`.venv/`)
- Reinstalling existing dependencies (e.g. `pip install -e ...`)
- Any change to `requirements.txt` or lockfiles

**Hard requirements:**
- If a fix seems to require a dependency change, stop and present the problem to the user first.
- Only proceed with a dependency change when the user has explicitly approved it **and** no other solution path remains.
- `bpm` (bambu-printer-manager) is considered stable. Assume it works correctly. Do not modify it to work around MCP-layer problems.

## Architecture

- **bambu-mcp** is an MCP server exposing Bambu Lab printer control as tools.
- All printer operations route exclusively through the **BPM library** (`bambu-printer-manager`) via `BambuPrinter` instances managed by `session_manager`.
- No tool may open its own direct FTPS, MQTT, socket, or HTTP connection to a printer — **with one exception**: camera streaming.
- **Camera streaming exception**: the `camera/` module is explicitly permitted to open direct connections to the printer for video data only:
  - **TCP+TLS port 6000** — A1/P1 series camera protocol (`TCPFrameBuffer` in `camera/tcp_stream.py`)
  - **RTSPS** — H2D/X1 series camera protocol (`RTSPSStreamSession` in `camera/rtsps_stream.py`)
  - These are raw video transports that BPM does not expose. No other module may use this exception.
- `bambu-printer-app` is a **knowledge reference only** — it must not be referenced or imported at runtime.

## BPM Usage

- Access printers via `session_manager.get_printer(name)` → `BambuPrinter` instance.
- Use `printer.*` methods for all printer interactions.
- Import BPM library modules (`from bpm.*`) only for types, helpers, and project parsing.
- BPM is stable — do not modify it to solve MCP-layer problems.
